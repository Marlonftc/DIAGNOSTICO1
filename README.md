Pokémon Finder is a full-stack web application built with Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.
It allows users to log in (without storing passwords), tracks login activity, and provides a Pokémon search and filter system powered by the PokéAPI.
The entire project is containerized using Docker and includes separate services for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB.
